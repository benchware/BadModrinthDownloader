# BadModrinthDownloader
An terrible coded Modrinth downloader that can download in bulks and it's fucking coded in Powershell.

## Features
- Bulk mods in Modrinth
- Written entirely in **Powershell**
- Minimal dependencies
## Installation
No installation required. Just download the downloader and run it with PowerShell.
## How to run?
1. Navigate to the repository and click "Code" and then click "Download ZIP"

2. Write your mods you need to download in the file `mods.txt`. You don't need a whole Visual Studio IDE for this. Just copy the links of the mods you want to install into that file. **Remember: Every mod you want to download should be on its own line. No extra characters, just plain text, each on a new row.**
3. Run the file called `MRDL.ps1`. It should download your mods in Modrinth. If it doesn't work, try running it again.

4. Your mods should be here. Move it to your server mods directory, or client whatever.
